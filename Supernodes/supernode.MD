# MATRIX Supernodes

### A detailed explanation of the delegate nodes (supernodes): How MATRIX can be more decentralized than EOS? How to choose delegate nodes and achieve consensus?

MATRIX is designed to have 21 delegate nodes, which are the agents for transaction processing. Different from the EOSâ€™ supernodes, the delegate nodes of MATRIX are randomly selected in every given period. Such a design is to maintain decentralization and fairness in the sense that the probability of a node staying as a delegate many times over is sufficiently low. A node has to make a given amount of deposits before it can attend the selection process. The period for a selection was chosen as approximately 10 minutes.
