# MATRIX SMARTCONTRACTS

##### We’ve recently discovered the BatchOverflow (link) vulnerability bug on ERC-20 smartcontracts. Let us assume that we found a bug on a MATRIX intelligent smartcontract, would the AI automatically fix and secure ALL the smart contracts on the MATRIX blockchain?


ANSWER: Let’s start by looking at the framework for our MATRIX SmartContracts.

Here is a more detailed explanation.

1.Our Semantic Engine will use semantic analysis to explore vulnerabilities. We are introducing AI functionality for smart matching, which matches images based on CFG (Control Flow Graph) and DFG (Data Flow Graph).  

2.Our secure smart contracts are implemented through our Smart Contract SDK.   

3.The whole security protocol is guaranteed via formal verification.

4.MATRIX is employing a dual approach to safeguard our smart contracts 

- A PC (Policy Checker) assesses vulnerabilities
- An IE (Inference Engine) and AI-assisted recognition detects vulnerabilities.
